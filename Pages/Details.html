	<p>Discover the best of the Dutch countryside with this Super Saver that pairs two popular tours in one day. Spend the morning in the windmill village of Zaanse Schans and visit a clog maker, and take a boat ride to the old-time fishing villages of Volendam and Marken, where you’ll taste traditional Dutch cheese.

Transport by air-conditioned coach from Amsterdam included</p>
	<h2>What to expect</h2>
	<p>Zaanse Schans Windmills, Marken and Volendam Half-Day Tour (5 hours):
In central Amsterdam, board an air-conditioned coach and travel with your guide through a picture-perfect landscape crisscrossed with canals as you head out of the city. 

Stop in the village of Zaanse Schans, where you'll see windmills and a historic shipyard. As you tour the town, learn more from your guide about this town renowned for its 17th- and 18th-century buildings that vividly depict historical Dutch life. Then visit a local shoemaker and watch clog-making techniques firsthand. 

Next, enjoy a 20-minute boat ride to Volendam and Marken. In these authentic fishing villages, locals still wear their colorful traditional dresses and the old wooden houses stand on stilts. After seeing the villages, head to a local cheese factory for a demonstration and tasting of cheese crafted in the traditional Dutch way.

Return by coach to Amsterdam, where you'll have 30 minutes of free time to relax and have lunch (own expense) before starting your tour of Keukenhof Gardens</p>
